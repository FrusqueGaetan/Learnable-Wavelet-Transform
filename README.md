# Learnable-Wavelet-Transform
Code tu use learnable wavelet transforms like L-WPT and DeSPaWN methods in pytorch 


Implementation of the L-WPT [1], [2] and Despawn (L-DWT) [3]. L-WPT is a learnable extension of the Wavelet Packet Transform while Despawn (L-DWT) is a learnable extension of the Discrete Wavelet Transform.
Both architecture can be called using the class NeuralDWAV.py (Neural Discrete Wavelet). Read me in progress
